          1. Pimpled Pathways: A Journey Through Acne and Self-Discovery
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          In the annals of my personal history, there exists a chapter that will
          forever be engraved in my heart – the tale of my epic journey with
          acne. At the tender age of eleven, acne became an unwelcomed companion
          on my journey through adolescence. It wasn't just a few pimples; it
          was a full-blown invasion, as if my face had declared a state of
          emergency and invited every zit in the vicinity to set up camp. Backle
          up, let me take you through this journey step by step. <br />At first,
          it was just a pimple here, a blemish there – nothing to write home
          about. But soon enough, my face resembled a battlefield, with acne
          laying siege to every square inch of my face. Gone were the days of
          smooth, unblemished perfection; in their place stood a canvas marred
          by angry red blotches and stubborn blackheads. <br />As if the
          physical attack wasn't enough, those red intruders on my face also had
          a knack for playing mind games with my fragile teenage esteem.
          Suddenly, I found myself grappling with feelings of inadequacy and
          self-doubt, as if my worth as a person was somehow tied to the state
          of my skin. The mirror became my mortal enemy, a cruel reflection of
          my perceived flaws and imperfections that seemed to mock me at every
          turn. <br />There are many stories to write about, but the real blow
          to my self-esteem was a visit to the hospital for a stomachache, that
          was hijacked by the doctor's incredulous reaction to my acne-ridden
          complexion. "Smallpox?" he exclaimed, as if diagnosing a rare tropical
          disease. I couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all – No,
          good sir, just your average, run-of-the-mill acne, thank you very
          much,” I responded.
        </p>
        <p class="span">
          &#10077; Your worth is not defined by the state of your
          skin &#33;.&#10078;
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          My journey in quest for a cure, would take me to the farthest reaches
          of medical science and beyond. Dermatologists became my reluctant
          allies, armed with an arsenal of creams, ointments, and questionable
          home remedies that promised to banish the unwanted intruders once and
          for all. I tried them all – from tea tree oil to toothpaste, from
          prescription-strength retinoids to the latest skincare – but alas, to
          no avail. <br />In the moment of desperation, I even entertained the
          idea of enlisting the help of a higher power, much to the amusement of
          my pragmatic mother. "Unataka kuenda kwa waganga?" she exclaimed.
          "Surely Brendah hizi ni gani tena umeanza?" But in my adolescent
          naivety, I clung to the hope that divine intervention might offer a
          reprieve from the relentless onslaught of pimples and blackheads.
          <br />As my acne persisted, so did the social ramifications. The cruel
          whispers and disdainful glances from classmates became a daily ordeal,
          driving me to the brink of isolation. I withdrew from social
          interactions, preferring the solitary confines of my room to the
          judgmental gazes of my peers. The loneliness weighed heavily on my
          esteem, plunging me into a dark abyss of despair where thoughts of
          self-harm seemed like the only escape from the suffocating grip of
          acne-induced misery. <br />I'll never forget the day I boarded a
          matatu and the lady next to me recoiled in horror as if she had just
          seen a ghost. From that moment on, I vowed to never leave the house
          without a hijab – a decision that led to no small amount of confusion
          and speculation among my peers. My mother bore witness to my silent
          suffering, her heart breaking with each tear I shed and each futile
          attempt to conceal my anguish. She tirelessly sought solutions,
          scouring the internet and consulting specialists in a desperate quest
          to alleviate my pain. The irony of her flawless complexion only added
          salt to the wounds, a cruel reminder of the genetic lottery that had
          bestowed upon me a face marred by imperfections. <br />The worst part
          about the whole experience was the unsolicited advice and well-meaning
          but misguided interventions from the people around me. Everyone had
          suddenly turned to a seasoned dermatologist and had a solution, except
          of course, me. <br />It wasn't until after high school that my skin
          finally began to clear, as if the acne had decided to pack its bags
          and vacate the premises without so much as a farewell. I couldn't
          pinpoint the exact moment of its departure or attribute it to any
          particular remedy; it was as if my skin had finally decided to heed my
          pleas for mercy and grant me the reprieve I so desperately craved.
          <br />To anyone battling acne, I offer this simple advice: hang in
          there. I won't pretend to have all the answers or offer false hope of
          a miraculous cure. But know that there is light at the end of the
          tunnel, even if it seems impossibly distant at times. Also, never
          forget, your worth is not defined by the state of your skin, and your
          journey is valid, no matter how arduous or fraught with setbacks. So
          keep fighting, keep believing, and never lose sight of the resilient
          spirit that resides within you, acne and all.

          2. A Letter to Myself: Navigating the Storms, Finding Serenity, and
          Embracing Realness
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Hello 24-year-old Brendah? Remember me? Let’s look back at where we
          were a year ago…. Brace yourself I know it wasn’t easy then. The day
          is 10/01/2024 at exactly 8:27pm the eve of your 23rd birthday. As I
          sit down to pen this piece, I feel a mix of emotions swirling within
          me. The first and foremost is an overwhelming sense of remorse, a need
          to apologize to the person who has endured so much in the past year –
          me. I am sorry for the tumultuous journey I allowed myself to embark
          upon in 2023, a year that, in many ways, feels like a dark chapter in
          my life. Also, dropping out of school without a plan? Classic move,
          right? I guess I was on a mission to keep life interesting. I’m also
          very sorry for not exploring my potential. I was too relaxed and
          terribly forgot to kujituma; turns out, potential doesn't
          self-discover on autopilot. Now, about that beautiful relationship –
          it's like I handed it over to a toddler with a crayon, and things got
          messy real quick. Toxic traits? Yeah, they had a party, and nobody was
          invited. Apologies to everyone caught in the crossfire. Relationships
          are like glass, and I threw some stones. My bad. Before I forget, to
          everyone caught in the mix of my 2023 shenanigans, consider this my
          virtual bouquet of apology flowers. If my actions were a movie, it
          would've been titled "Drama Unleashed: The Sequel to Bad Life
          Choices." I've had my popcorn, and I'm ready to admit that my
          performance wasn't Oscar-worthy. I am genuinely sorry for the mess I
          created. I might not be good at relationships, but hey, at least I'm
          trying to master the art of saying sorry. Now, let's switch gears from
          the sad violin music to a more upbeat tune because 2024 is all about
          redemption, baby! I'm practically auditioning for the lead role in
          "The Comeback Kid." Writing, my long-lost love, we're rekindling our
          romance. My Medium page is now my drama-infused diary. Call it a
          journal, call it a rant zone – it's where I'll spill my guts and hope
          someone out there gets it. Hold on tight, because I've enrolled in the
          School of Becoming a Software Wizard. Forget wands; I'm conjuring code
          and making binary my second language. Vlogs? Oh, you bet! I’ll be
          joining youtube very soon. Infact, sooner than you’d imagine. Get
          ready for the thrilling saga of a former dropout turned aspiring tech
          maestro. Spoiler alert: there will be errors, plenty of them. Now,
          about the hush-hush project with my cousin – it's like the secret
          sauce to our future success. We're still in the "let's plan without
          revealing too much" stage, but it's brewing, my friend. Picture two
          masterminds plotting world domination, or at least a solid business
          venture. Its going to be lifechanging, best believe. As I pen down
          these words, there's a cocktail of emotions swirling within me – a mix
          of regret, excitement, and a pinch of humor. Here's to hoping that
          when I revisit this letter on my 24th birthday, I'll have transformed
          from the "Oops-I-Did-It-Again" protagonist to the hero of my own
          story. Keeping it real, Stopbeingobsessedwithme.

        <h2 class="h2">3. Turning the Page: The Courage to Start Over</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          So, picture this: it's your last year of university, and you're
          supposed to be gearing up for the grand finale, tossing that
          graduation cap into the air with pride. But instead, you're
          contemplating a plot twist of epic proportions. That's exactly where I
          found myself not too long ago. With just one year left in uni, I made
          the audacious decision to switch careers. It wasn't an easy choice,
          but deep down, I believed it was the right one for me. Sure, I knew
          there would be challenges, but I didn't anticipate the relentless
          waves of self-doubt and uncertainty that would come crashing down on
          me like a ton of bricks Was I making the right decision? Would I end
          up living in a cardboard box under a bridge somewhere, regretting my
          life choices? These were the pressing questions keeping me up at
          night. Starting over is like deciding to do a high-wire act without a
          safety net. It's thrilling, terrifying, and a tad bit insane. You're
          essentially saying, "Hey, world, I know I've invested time and energy
          into this thing, but I'm gonna hit the reset button and try something
          completely different." It's like deciding to switch from being a dog
          person to a cat person overnight – a total leap of faith. So, armed
          with nothing but my determination and a hefty dose of self-belief, I
          took the plunge into the great unknown. It wasn't and still isn’t
          easy. There are moments when I question my sanity, moments when I want
          to crawl back into the cozy cocoon of familiarity. But every time
          doubt rears its ugly head, I remind myself that I am the author of my
          own story. I do not need anyone else to hold the pen. And the best
          part, slowly but surely, I’m starting to find my footing in this brave
          new world. I have discovered passions I never knew I had, met people
          who inspire me, and forged a path that feels uniquely mine. Icing on
          the cake? I’m still in the shallow end of my new journey. That means,
          I have my entire life to fall and stand up, perfect my skill, and show
          off to the world. One of the toughest parts? Convincing my mom. She
          had always dreamed of seeing me walk across that stage, degree in
          hand. She always wanted me to be a diplomat or an ambassador. But I
          knew in my heart that chasing someone else's dream wasn't the way to
          find fulfillment. It took countless conversations and tearful
          explanations, but eventually, she came around to the idea that my path
          was mine to forge. Watching my friends graduate was bittersweet. I
          felt genuine happiness for them, but there was a twinge of sadness
          knowing that I wasn't sharing in their milestone moment. We often
          talked about graduating together and even making tiktok videos with
          our gowns. On the graduation day, I shed a few (read rivers) tears,
          not out of envy, but out of a sense of loss for the path I had chosen
          to leave behind. It was heavy, but i was happy for them. They are the
          real MVPs. Adding insult to injury are the judgmental whispers and
          raised eyebrows from those who think they know better. They question
          your choices, offer unsolicited advice, and make you doubt yourself
          even more. It's tempting to let their words sink in, to let them
          dictate the course of your life, to heed their warnings, to retreat to
          the safety of the familiar, but deep down, we know that the only voice
          worth listening to is the one within. And it's not just in career
          transitions where starting over can feel like navigating a minefield.
          Take relationships, for example. You've built a life with someone,
          made memories, and carved out a routine together. But sometimes,
          despite the history and the comfort, you realize that it's time to
          walk away and start anew. It's heart-wrenching, gut-churning, and
          downright terrifying. So here's the thing about starting over: it's
          messy, it's chaotic, and it's utterly scary. But it's also
          exhilarating, liberating, and full of endless possibilities. It's
          about having the courage to let go of what no longer serves you and
          embrace the unknown with open arms. Sure, there will be moments of
          doubt and fear, but they're all part of the ride. And when you finally
          establish your balance in this brave new world, you'll look back on
          your journey with a sense of pride and accomplishment. Because in the
          end, starting over isn't just about changing your circumstances – it's
          about rediscovering who you are and what you're truly capable of.

        <h2 class="h2">4. My Tech Journey of Trial andTriumphs</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Ah, this tech journey. It's a wild ride filled with exhilarating
          highs, frustrating lows, and everything in between. Let me take you
          through my rollercoaster of experience, where difficulty and fun dance
          together in perfect harmony. Mind you, it has only been a little under
          two months since I set out on this journey. First off, let me address
          the elephant in the room: tech is hard. Like, really hard. I was well
          aware of this even before I decided to join the older tech bros and
          babes. There have been countless moments where I've stared at my
          screen, trying to wrap my head around a particularly thorny concept,
          only to feel like I'm banging my head against a digital brick wall.
          It's tempting to throw in the towel, close the laptop, and crawl into
          bed, hoping that sleep will magically bestow upon me the answer I
          seek. And you know what? Sometimes it does. I mean, what can’t
          sleeping fix save a broken heart? It's almost comical how the
          subconscious mind can work wonders. I'll drift off into dreamland,
          only to wake up with a eureka moment, a solution to the problem that
          plagued me just hours before. It's like my brain was quietly churning
          away in the background, untangling the knots of confusion while I
          slept. And when I wake up, groggy but triumphant, I can't help but
          smile. There's a strange joy in overcoming those mental hurdles, in
          outsmarting your own brain. But let me not sugarcoat it: the road to
          tech enlightenment is littered with obstacles. There have been times
          when I've seriously considered saying fuck this shit I’m done, when
          I've questioned whether I have what it takes to make it in this field.
          I even ghosted my mentor once, convinced that I wasn't cut out for
          this line of work. But you know what they say: every setback is just a
          setup for a comeback. And comeback I did. With each hurdle I cleared,
          each challenge I conquered, I grew stronger and more determined. I
          started to find my footing, to establish a sense of balance in this
          chaotic world of code and algorithms. And let me tell you, there's
          nothing quite like the feeling of finally cracking a tough problem, of
          seeing your code come to life before your eyes. But it's not all
          blood, sweat, and tears. There's a lot of fun to be had in the world
          of tech, too. Like when you start to understand the bits of jargon
          that techies throw around on Twitter (X), and you feel like you're
          part of some exclusive club. Sure, it can be intimidating to jump into
          the conversation, to put yourself out there and risk looking like a
          newbie. But hey, we were all beginners once, right? And besides,
          nobody ever learned anything by staying silent. So here I am,
          embracing the chaos and reveling in the challenges that come my way.
          Sure, there are still days when I want to throw my laptop out the
          window and scream into the void. But those moments are outweighed by
          the sheer joy and satisfaction of learning something new, of pushing
          myself to be better than I was yesterday. So yeah, i am embracing the
          struggle, relishing the victories, and I’ll never be afraid to dive
          headfirst into the fray. Because the journey may be hard, but it's
          also incredibly rewarding. Maybe one day, I'll look back at my own
          tech journey and realize that the ups and downs were all part of the
          fun. But honestly so far, Javascript is kicking my ass proper.
